Battleship is a classic two-player strategy game where each player has a fleet of ships on a grid and takes turns trying to locate and sink the opponent's fleet. The following are the basic rules of Battleship:

**Setup:**
1. Each player has their own grid (typically 10x10), where they place their ships.
2. The standard fleet consists of five ships: Carrier (5 cells), Battleship (4 cells), Cruiser (3 cells), Submarine (3 cells), and Destroyer (2 cells).
3. Players place their ships on the grid vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.
4. Ships cannot overlap or extend beyond the boundaries of the grid.

**Gameplay:**
1. Players take turns calling out coordinates (e.g., "B4") to target a cell on the opponent's grid.
2. The opponent responds with "hit" if there is a part of a ship at the targeted cell or "miss" if there isn't.
3. Players mark their own grid with hits and misses to track the progress of the game.
4. If a player successfully hits every cell of an opponent's ship, that ship is considered sunk.
5. The game continues until one player's entire fleet is sunk.

**Winning:**
The first player to sink the entire opponent's fleet wins the game.

**Special Rules:**
- Some versions of the game allow players to call out coordinates for individual shots, while others use a system of coordinated attacks, such as firing a "salvo" (a group of shots equal to the number of remaining ships).
- Some variants include special shots, such as "air raids" or "mines."

It's essential to establish the rules before playing, as variations exist, and house rules may be applied. The game often requires a balance of strategy and deduction as players try to locate and sink their opponent's ships.
